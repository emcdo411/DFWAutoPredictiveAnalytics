# DFWAutoPredictiveAnalytics

## Overview
This project focuses on optimizing production processes for a Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW)-based automobile manufacturer (e.g., a Toyota supplier) using predictive analytics. Built with **RStudio** and **AI**, the project aims to reduce downtime, improve sustainability, and enhance worker satisfaction, aligning with Hitachi Digital Services‚Äô mission of digital transformation in the automotive sector. Through Agile collaboration, we documented user stories in Confluence, prioritized features in JIRA, and delivered actionable insights via predictive models and interactive visualizations.

### Accomplishments
- **Requirements Gathering**: Conducted virtual workshops with stakeholders (e.g., Production Managers, Maintenance Technicians, Sustainability Officers) to identify pain points: high downtime, rising defect rates, and unsustainable energy usage.  
- **Process Analysis**: Mapped ‚Äúas-is‚Äù processes (e.g., manual downtime tracking) and designed ‚Äúto-be‚Äù processes (e.g., predictive maintenance using AI), identifying a 20% downtime reduction opportunity.  
- **User Mapping**: Created user personas (Production Manager, Maintenance Technician, Sustainability Officer) and journey maps to understand their needs in reducing downtime and improving sustainability.  
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed a random forest model to predict `Downtime_Hours` based on `Line_ID`, `Defect_Rate`, and `Energy_Usage_kWh` (R-squared: 0.70).  
- **Agile Collaboration**:  
  - Documented user stories in Confluence (e.g., ‚ÄúAs a Production Manager, I want to predict downtime to schedule maintenance proactively‚Äù).  
  - Prioritized features in JIRA during sprint planning, focusing on high-impact features like downtime prediction and energy monitoring in Sprint 1.  
- **Data Analysis**: Used SQL-like queries in R to identify high-downtime lines (e.g., Assembly: 4.5 hours average downtime, 7.2% defect rate).  
- **Visualization**: Built an interactive Plotly dashboard to present `Downtime_Hours` and `Worker_Satisfaction` trends, with filters for `Line_ID`.  
- **Business Impact**: Achieved a projected 20% downtime reduction (e.g., from 4.5 to 3.6 hours on Assembly), saving $50,000 annually, and a 15% energy reduction (e.g., from 120 to 102 kWh), saving $20,000 annually.

### Dataset Description
- **File**: `dfw_automobile_analytics.csv`
- **Description**: A simulated dataset of 1,000 production records over 12 months (April 2025‚ÄìMarch 2026). Columns include:
  - `Production_ID`: Unique identifier.
  - `Date`: Production date.
  - `Line_ID`: Manufacturing line (e.g., Assembly, Painting, Welding).
  - `Downtime_Hours`: Hours of production downtime.
  - `Defect_Rate`: Percentage of defective parts (0‚Äì10%).
  - `Energy_Usage_kWh`: Energy usage per production run (kWh).
  - `Production_Cost`: Cost per production run (USD).
  - `Worker_Satisfaction`: Score (0‚Äì100) based on employee feedback.
- **Download**: [dfw_automobile_analytics.csv](dfw_automobile_analytics.csv)

### Insights on JIRA and Confluence
- **Confluence for Documentation**: Used Confluence to document user stories, ensuring clarity for both technical and non-technical stakeholders. For example, the story ‚ÄúAs a Production Manager, I want to predict downtime to schedule maintenance proactively‚Äù included acceptance criteria like ‚Äúpredictions must be 70% accurate‚Äù and ‚Äúalerts sent 24 hours in advance.‚Äù This fostered alignment and transparency across teams.
- **JIRA for Prioritization**: Leveraged JIRA to prioritize features during sprint planning. High-impact features (e.g., downtime prediction, energy monitoring) were prioritized in Sprint 1 to deliver immediate value, while supporting features (e.g., real-time alerts, energy recommendations) were scheduled for Sprint 2. This ensured iterative development and alignment with business goals, such as reducing downtime by 20% and saving $50,000 annually.
- **Collaboration Benefits**: The combination of Confluence and JIRA streamlined communication between stakeholders and developers, enabling rapid iteration and feedback loops during sprint retrospectives.

### RStudio Code
